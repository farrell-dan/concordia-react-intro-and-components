# react-intro-and-components

## 🦊 Pre-lecture

⏲️ _Estimated time required: 20 minutes._


Glance through [this guide](https://heynode.com/tutorial/what-packagejson/) on `package.json` files.  The two most important fields for us will be `"dependancies"` and `"scripts"`.


Take a look at [react documentation's quick start](https://react.dev/learn).  You can stop at Conditional Rendering - we won't be covering that nor topics below that in this lecture.
