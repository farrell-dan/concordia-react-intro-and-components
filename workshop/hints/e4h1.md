## Having difficulty importing your css file?

---

When you import a module, a function, an array, etc, you need to create a new variable so you can reference that data.

ex:
```js
import App from "./App.js"

```

In the above code, you have create a variable called `App`, and it contains whatever `App.js` default exported.

css works differently.  You don't store css into a vairable.  Instead, importing it tells react that so long as this file is being rendered, these css rules will be applied.

Don't worry if you find this confusing - that's normal.

The practical difference here is that you don't need to create a variable when you import css:

```js
import "./styles.css";

```
