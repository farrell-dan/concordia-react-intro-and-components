## Having difficulty with createRoot?

---

In the `src/index.js` file, the `createRoot` method is being passed `document.getElementById("root")`, but this is not resulting in a DOM element.

In the `index.js`, you can add some code above the execution of `createRoot`:

```js
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

console.log(document.getElementById("root"));
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

root.render("Hello World");
```

What are you seeing in the browser's console?

This must mean that there is no HTML element of id = "root".

The only place in this workshop where we have html elements (at the moment), is in the `public/index.html`...
